## A test for all humanity

I really am not sure what to expect here, but here's a hope:

* That you know what you're doing
* That I don't know what **I'm** doing
* That this list is over with

While I like typing text, let's have some filler Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi in velit quam, sollicitudin elementum elit. Suspendisse ut leo quis lacus gravida rutrum[^foo]. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Vivamus nisl mauris, interdum sed vulputate eu, rhoncus quis massa. Ut sodales hendrerit ipsum, sit amet ultricies tellus fermentum eget. Integer tempor est non metus sollicitudin volutpat.

And now for something completely different.  

[^foo]: This is a footnote.

### 2.1 Coding Support

What follows is an example of code block formatting.

    function foo {
        // me so happy  
        print("meh");
    }

Additionally, code items may occur inline like `foo{return(bar);}` for what it's worth.

### 2.2 Image Support

As for image support, the following highlights a PNG.  As the Jekyll default markdown engine ([Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html)) doesn't support some advanced MMD image metadata features, those should be avoided.  Additionally, this example links to itself.

### 2.3 Table Support

This is just a simple test to see if the table type layouts work at all for my precious Jekyll.

| Column One | Column Two                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| oh boy big | boy, where the magic comes alive |
| why?       | because we can                   |
| who?       | you there, with the head!        |
